A dedicated Master of Data Science graduate at the University of British Columbia. Passionate about data modelling and machine learning, I find joy in tackling challenging tasks that push the boundaries of my knowledge. With my degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and engineering background to the field of data science. Outside of my academic pursuits, I love immersing myself in the beauty of nature through short hikes and find solace in the world of music and gaming. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate!
